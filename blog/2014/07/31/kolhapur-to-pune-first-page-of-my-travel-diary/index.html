<div class="entry-content"><p>Kolhapur to Pune turned out to be my first long drive. The journey I had while driving to Pune was wonderful. I would say it will surely be one of the best journeys of my life as it is the first page in my travel diary.</p>

<p>One thing I learnt from this ride, destination is never as important as the journey you go through while arriving to your destination. After giving a thought I realized that this thing is not only about a ride, it’s applicable for your life as well. At the end you only remember the times where you have all of your experiences, memories and joys to reach to the final point. The time you take to reach to destination just keeps on building excitement and thats the feeling which makes your journey memorable.</p>

<p>And the day arrived, 27 July, 2014, It was just after a couple of week from the day I got my machine.  As it was my first long ride and that to in peak rainy season where nature come outside with all it’s beauty and greenery. I was totally excited about the journey, but having hell lot of questions in mind. I was totally blank about the things which one should take care before going for a long drive. While reading about it I came across various experiences expressed by riders. Its just like a awesome feeling where you start knowing your partner more and more in a relationship. I hope, I will come more close to my enfield as we both travel more journeys together.</p>

<p>Journey from kolhapur to pune has a quite a distance of 225 kms. This whole track NH4 is very decent track having throughout 6 lane road. It will not be the case where you will have the adventure ride in this journey but you will definitely have very comfortable and pleasant ride where you can enjoy the company of Sanhyadri mountain range  in the whole journey. Gurudatta, my friend, was pillion rider for this ride. We were so lucky that we had my first long ride in this beautiful climate.</p>

<p>It was a peak of rainy season. There were no lack green colour any where. Its just amazing feeling of riding your bike in rainy season. You could see all the different shades in sky. You could see heavy rain in mountain. You could see nature taking new life and flourishing itself with all the possible beauty. It’s just perfect combo pack for you, awesome road and so the climate. I agree rainy season is the best season to have long rides on your bike to enjoy the awesomeness of nature but at the same time you should be totally patient and and always keep safety in your mind as roads might get too much slippery in period.</p>

<p>As road was smooth and comfortable, we never felt exhausted. We still keep on taking 5 10 minutes break after 60 70 kms. In between there are many good places like Karad, Satara Bhuinj where you can have good food and give rest to you and your bike. While we were passing Satara, bunch of fully armed bulleteers crossed us. It was feeling like we were knowing each other. Everyone was having so much discipline in there driving that it felt like all of them were giving respect to each other and thats exactly it should be. Riding is art and you should not spoil it by rash driving. It should be the journey that you enjoy, not the speed</p>

<p>After having this ride of whole 250+ kms, I fell in love with this machine again. It is totally sturdy and steady bike. You get total comfort and pleasure while riding it. At no point of time you feel strain or get bored in the ride. After a ride also you remain as fresh as the time where you star journey. This bike will definitely be my long time partner. Hopefully we both will come on the road to meet nature in this amazing season soon. Till then be a Rider as there are hell lot of things to meet and visit in this world. Enjoy your life, Ride safe.</p>
