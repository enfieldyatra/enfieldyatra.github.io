<div class="entry-content"><p>Ummm &hellip; . People always ask “why you went for royal enfield when there are other bikes available in the market ?” Its really hard to answer this question because you can&rsquo;t explain it, one has to feel it. Royal Enfield is THE bike which is &ldquo;Made like a Gun and goes like a Bullet&rdquo;</p>

<p>Craze, Comfort, Passion, Thrill, Power, Thump, Love, Beauty, there are so many things you feel about royal enfield that you fall short of words to express them.
The bond between bulleteers and their machine always fascinates me. Its really awesome. “Bull” as they call it, is always treated way more than a vehicle. Emotional relationship which riders develop towards their machine can only be understood by those who have a similar passion. “Love is what you feel when you like something as much as your motorcycle” perfectly explains this relationship. Because of this passion there is different kind of brotherhood amongst all RE’ians. That’s why if you need an explanation for why its enfield, you won’t get it.</p>

<p>Many say it has mechanical problems, is overrated and overpriced, delivers lower mileage, vibrates a lot, makes hell lot of noise etc. For a bulleteer, its never about money or mileage. As I said, it’s always about the bond and love for the bullet which you can&rsquo;t measure in terms of money.</p>

<p>For many people, sound of Bullet is very displeasing.  But it is as melodious as music for a royal enfield owner. Every time your heart starts beating with the strokes of your machine, you get feel of having born a new life.</p>

<p>Royal enfield has the capacity to perform exceptionally well in all beautiful and tough terrains of india. Khardung La in Ladakh - the highest motorable road on earth is one such place. For this very reason, the Indian Army is also using it extensively in such terrains since a long period of time. I think royal enfield can give you the desired comfort and pleasure through the most amazing rides from the northern extreme Himalayas to southern coastal area and from the western deserts of Rajasthan to eastern hilly terrains on Darjeeling.</p>

<p>To own a royal enfield is not just an event in your life, it’s a life long journey. For me, it is always this bike and long roads which give inner peace. Through every journey you will get amazed by finding new perspective towards your life. I can clearly state royal enfield is the perfect companion for that.</p>

<p>So to summarize, if you need an answer for Why Enfield ? just go and ride the BULL once, you will understand all the feelings I tried to express.</p>
