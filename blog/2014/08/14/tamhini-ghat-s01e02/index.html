<div class="entry-content"><p>If you are searching for place, where you can have short monsoon trip, then Tamini Ghat is a great option. It is the perfect getaway if you want to enjoy the ride to fullest without investing your full weekend. It is on the crest of Western Ghat mountain ranges, nearly 100Kms from Pune and 150Kms from Mumbai. Tamhini Ghat Road is located between Mulsi to Tamhini route which connects Konkan from Pune. The entire Ghat section is almost 15 to 20 Km.</p>

<p>We started our journey at 9 am on a Saturday morning. We were totally amazed by scenic waterfalls, awesome Mulsi Lake and dense greenery that covered the entire stretch. The roads are mostly good except very few sections where the roads were in a messed up state due to heavy rains. As the route involves mostly Ghat like roads,  if you are visiting in peak monsoons, you need to be cautious about driving.</p>

<p>Best thing about this Ghat is that at every turn, you get a chance to admire nature. You can’t stop yourself from taking frequent breaks, just to enjoy the scenic surroundings like the amazing waterfalls. View you get to see is so breathtaking, that you just want to capture everything in your mind. It will give you so much peace, that you will get totally refreshed. The mountains are totally covered by greenery and a thick layer of clouds surrounds them. While riding you get a feeling that you are going to touch the clouds.</p>

<p>The taste of ‘Bhutta’ in the rains is so awesome, that you can just keep on eating it. The  best thing is that there is no dearth of vendors and you can easily purchase a ‘bhutta’ at every few kms. Apart from this there are many hotels where you can enjoys ‘Chai’ and ‘Pakodas’, as well as other maharashtrian dishes.</p>

<p>The route is such that you can continue to go as far as you want, or as per your time constraints you can take U-turn and enjoy the ride back to Pune. The amazing part is that you get to see whole route again, but in different shades of sunlight and clouds. While returning to Pune we encountered very dense fog, and hence had to drive very slow. The situation was quite difficult, as we were having problems with visibility for distance beyond a meter.</p>

<p>As I always say though this ghat is amazing, along with admiring nature, also keep an eye on the road and the traffic. You should drive slowly and carefully so that your driving does not harm yourself or others.</p>
